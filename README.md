# Greetings to My Portfolio!

## Introduction:

As we are all well aware, coding is a cummulative learning process. More complex skills and applications depend upon previously learned basic and essential skills and tools. In that vein, below I will display some examples of more complex applications of code that I have learned so far, which will also contain use of such basics.

## Examples:

### Reading and Cleaning Data:

To begin, every good data analysis begins with reading in and cleaning the data; here is an example of this skill.

[Example](Reading-and-Cleaning-Data.md)

### Computational Exploratory Data Analysis:

It is very insightful to compute and display summary statistics for data. Displaying such information within a table can allow for easy statistical tests and analysis.

[Example](Computational-EDA.md)

### Visual Exploratory Data Analysis:

Tables that display summary statistics are great for EDA; however, a visual display, such as a graph, brings more to the table. Graphs can provide an idea of how normal the data is, a visual of the spread of the data and good overview of the most important summary statistics, though this overview would not be as exact as a computed table's EDA. Graphs such as boxplots even show outliers of the data. 

[Example](Visual-EDA.htm)

### Merging Data Frames:

It may sometimes be necessary to combine data from different files into one dataframe for analysis. There are many ways to do this and each often results in a different dataframe layout. 

[Example](Merging-Data-Frames.md)

### For and While Loops with If, Elif and Else Conditions:

Loops and conditions are tools that are often used for more complex operations, but in and of themselves, they are complex and a little more difficult to employ. They can be used to make complex systems, such as in this example.

[Example](For-and-While-Loop.htm)

### Advanced Data Visualization:

As was mentioned above, visual displays of data can be great for viewing different trends in data. There are more advanced ways to visualize data through the use of seaborn and subplots.

[Example](Advanced-Data-Visualization.htm)

### Biomedical Image Analysis:

Biomedical image analysis entails displaying biomedical images, even volumes of images in 3-dimensions. Analysis can be done through upsampling and downsampling the images, displaying intensity histograms to aid in creating masks and equalizing images, and applying filters, masks, erosion, and dilation, as well as observing differences between two images. Some of these analysis methods are displayed in the example below.

[Example](Biomedical-Image-Analysis.htm)

### Spike Train Data Visualization:

Spike train data can be visualized through rastor plots, peri-stimulus time histograms and heat maps. These can all be used to determine when neurons are most likely to fire, whether that be under a condition or at a particular time. 

[Example](Spike-Train-Data-Visualization.htm)

### EEG and ERP Data:

Being able to display and analyze EEG and ERP data is essential when working with neurons. In NESC 3505, we covered this topic relatively briefly in the textbook and more practically in the 2nd project of the course. We also covered MNE-Python. Almost all of the code that we learned regarding this topic was acquired through the 2nd project, and therefore, displaying my proficiency in this topic would overlap a great deal with the examples in the project. This is not feasible, for we are not authorized to use examples from the course material. Additionally, EEG and ERP data is hard to find online (I looked). Therefore, I opted not to make an example covering this material, as an aside, what we learned was relatively basic and heavy on MNE-Python from the MNE API. In conclusion, I decided that it would be best to outline the skills that I learned in this topic briefly here. 

I learned how to:
* Calculate grand averages
* Visualize ERP waveforms
* Visualize topographic maps
* Calculate difference waves
* Visualize difference waves
* Plot mean amplitudes for given time windows
* Perform statistical tests

## Thank you for taking the time to look through my portfolio! Cheers!
