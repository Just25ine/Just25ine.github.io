# Greetings to My Portfolio!

## Introduction:

As we are all well aware, coding is a cummulative learning process. More complex skills and applications depend upon previously learned basic and essential skills and tools. In that vein, below I will display some examples of more complex applications of code that I have learned so far, which will also contain use of such basics.

## Examples:

### Reading and Cleaning Data:

To begin, every good data analysis begins with reading in and cleaning the data; here is an example of this skill.

[Example](Reading-and-Cleaning-Data-Example.md)

### Computational Exploratory Data Analysis:

It is very insightful to compute and display summary statistics for data. Displaying such information within a table can allow for easy statistical tests and analysis.

[Example](Computational-EDA-Example.md)

### Visual Exploratory Data Analysis:

Tables that display summary statistics are great for EDA; however, a visual display, such as a graph, brings more to the table. Graphs can provide an idea of how normal the data is, a visual of the spread of the data and good overview of the most important summary statistics, though this overview would not be as exact at a tables EDA would. Graphs such as boxplots even show outliers of the data.

### Merging Data Frames:

It may sometimes be necessary to combine data from different files into one dataframe for analysis. There are many ways to do this and each often results in a different dataframe layout. 

[Example](Merging-Dataframes-Example.md)

### For and While Loops with If, Elif and Else Conditions:

Loops and conditions are tools that are often used for more complex operations, but in and of itself, they are complex and a little more difficult to employ. They can be used to make complex systems, such as in this example.
